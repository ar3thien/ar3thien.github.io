I am a technical engineer from the IT world. I have over 10 years of experience in different companies from  different locations in the world. In this blog I write my personal documentations of few projects I'm working on. I believe that every project comes out of a need. Therefore, you will see an objective section under each post. My interests fall around cloud computing, linux os, opensource router firmwares, networking, and much more...
In case you have any question or remark, do not hesitate to drop me an email.

ENJOY READING !
